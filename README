This code is a tracking project implemented using OpenCV.

OpenCV is used for all the image processing functions. Right now all of this is the file main.py

A Particle filter is implemented (home made) based on Condensation (not using OpenCV's condensation). It not depends on OpenCV. It is the file ParticleFilter.py

A SOM was implemented based on the C++ implementation by ai-junkines, that's somBasic.py. Then it was hacked with numpy, it is quite faster and a bit different code, it is named som.py. It is also OpenCV independent apart from visualizing it, but the visualization can be performed with any other lib.
